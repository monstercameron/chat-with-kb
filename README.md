# ðŸ“š Document Embedder and Contextual Assistant

Welcome to the **Document Embedder and Contextual Assistant** project! This powerful Python application is designed to transform large documents into meaningful embeddings, store them in a vector database, and use them to enhance the context history of language models. The result? Quick and highly relevant responses that are more personalized than traditional search engines.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Document Embedding**: Convert large documents into compact and meaningful embeddings that capture the essence of the content.
- **Vector Database**: Store and efficiently retrieve document embeddings using a vector database optimized for similarity search.
- **Contextual Assistance**: Inject relevant data into the context history of language models to provide personalized and context-aware responses.

## ðŸ“š Prerequisites

To use this project, you'll need the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- An NLP library for generating embeddings (e.g., sentence-transformers)
- A vector database (e.g., Faiss or Annoy)
- A language model (e.g., GPT-3 or similar)

## ðŸš€ Installation

To install the required Python packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
